# CAB301-JobsADS
Semester 2, 2023, CAB301 Assessment 1

This repository stores the solution to the QUT Unit "Algorithms and Complexity" (CAB301) Semester 1 2023 Assessment 1 "Algorithm ANalysis".

The Interface files, method signatures and their pre and post conditions of the computer Jobs abstract data strcucture were provided and 
could not be editted in its implementation. The extentions of these interfaces, and test classes is where the implementation took place.

The abstract data structure (ADS) in question was the modelling of computer tasks "Jobs" to be executed by a computer operating system. 
The purpose of the bstract data structure was to be able to schedule collections of these job objects with respect to a cpecific field.
These fields are the Jobs runtime received "TimeReceived", execution duration "ExecutionTime", Identifier "Id" and priority "Priority".
